				Welcome to my website!<br />
				This site started as a WordPress back when I was a freshman in college. Back then, it was named Nature Sketcher, because I like sketching in the nature.<br />
				It was just a blog to journal about the daily amusement of life.<br />
				At the time, I would never thought that I would ever hand-code an entire website!<br />
				Anyhow, welcome, and I hope you enjoy your stay!<br />
