Box:
Final project for first woodshop class. My focus was to create a box that use as less glue as possible. The idea of the joints fitting together like a jagsaw and being easy to disassemble would later progress and develope into my 5th year furniture competition entry, Flip Flop Chair. The box is currently still in good form, serving as an excellent book holder next to my bed despite being knock over several times upon my search for my alarm clock.
