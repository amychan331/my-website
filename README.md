This is a repo containing codes for my portfolio.

The purpose of renovating for website is:

1) Want to practice my web programming skills.

2) To make the site mobile responsive.

3) To find an elegant way to organized and display portfolio works from both my period in the architecture industry and my current period in computer science.

4) To create a better navigation system. Before, my website was a Wordpress blog, where the navigation merely takes you to another page that contain an embedded code from Issuu.
