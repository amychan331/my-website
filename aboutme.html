	<p>
	This blog started back in my freshman year of college. A small outlet for the occasional amusement found in life. The writing here are scattered with different subjects. Its theme, after all, is about exploration. It chronicles new things I discover and fun things that I like to do. There is so much to enjoy about life:
	<ul class=indent>
	<li>I write and blog.</li>
	<li>I read and drink coffee.</li>
	<li>I knit and make jewelries.</li>
	<li>I bicycle and skates.</li>
	<li>I walk around parks and sketch.</li>
	<li>I spend a day indoor to code.</li>
	<li>I garden and bake.</li>
	<li>I take apart my Macbook to clean.</li>
	</ul>
There is so much to explore. What are you doing today?
