# Craft Plus Tech: More PHP MVC. Adaptive design. Attempts on Accessibility

## Summary
This is a repo for my portfolio website. The site was built on LAMP and with a self-made MVC, since I figure a small portfolio site like this would be a easy and fun to practice MVC skills back when I first started learning it.
Designed with progressive enhancement in mind, incorporting mobile-friendly design and accessibility features.

## Fun features
* The image carousel is web accessible! They are friendly to tab navigation and screen text reader. Give it a try. If problem occur, please let me know!
* The blog page is actually generated with WordPress loop and grabs data from my WP blog on demand. Most of the code is in the application/model/blog.php section.

## Language
HTML, CSS, JS with jQuery, PHP.
